Simple but scalable Coffee Machine
---
#### Right now there are only 3 types of coffee that a user can request (Latte/Cappuccino/Espresso) but can easily be extended to N types of coffee
---
##### The app also keeps track of the Coffee Machine ingredients and the income and it has 4 options from which the user can choose to handle it
---
1. `buy` (an option that allows the user to buy some type of coffee of his choosing by typing the number of the coffee type)
2. `fill` (an option that can fill the Coffee Machine with ingredients (water/milk/coffee beans/disposable cups)
3. `take` (an option that allows the user to take all the money stored in the Coffee Machine)
4. `remaining` (an option that displays the amount of all ingredients and the income inside the Coffee Machine)
---
### Example (character `>` is the user's input):
